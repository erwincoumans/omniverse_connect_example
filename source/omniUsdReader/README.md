# Simple Omniverse USD Reader App

This directory contains a sample program that will initialize Omniverse, open a USD file, and print all of the prim node paths within.  It is used in a walkthrough available in the [Connect Sample docs](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/con_connect/con_connect/connect-sample.html) and on the [Connect Sample forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/creating-an-omniverse-usd-app-from-the-connect-sample)

* `OmniUSDReader.cpp` - the sample program source code
* `scripts/copy_binary_deps.bat` - run as a post-build event after the app builds in Visual Studio
